Linear Regression - Weather Humidity Prediction
ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project analyzes 96,453 hourly weather observations across 12 features, focusing on predicting humidity levels based on other weather parameters.
The dataset includes temperature, wind speed, pressure, and other meteorological measurements.

Features Used:

Temperature (C)

Apparent Temperature (C)

Wind Speed (km/h)

Wind Bearing (degrees)

Visibility (km)

Pressure (millibars)

Models Implemented & Performance
Model	MAE	MSE	RÂ²
Linear Regression	0.11	0.02	0.47
Ridge Regression	0.11	0.02	0.47
Lasso Regression	0.15	0.03	0.13

Key Insight: Linear & Ridge Regression performed best with RÂ² = 0.47, explaining ~47% of the variance in humidity.
